This is my hobby website that I run, I write articles about tech and gaming and post an article about once every two weeks. It used to be an actual PROGRAMMING project that I was using to learn html but now it's just for fun since I'm using python and learning C. I don't own most of the images on my site, almost all are taken from various sites throughout the internet, but please note I don't make any money off this site and all images belong to their respective owners. With that out of the way, bookmark my site and check back from time to time! Thanks! - ChillZeus
