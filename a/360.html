<h1>Why Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition is my favorite</h1>
<p>Lately I’ve been playing a good deal of Minecraft Xbox 360 edition with my siblings, and I’ve realized 
it may be my all time favorite version of Minecraft. It’s based on 1.8 and It’s at that perfect time in the
progression of Minecraft where we have made it past the very early days where the game was limited and in
some cases boring. There are still plenty of hurdles to jump through and things to do in this game, but it is
also early enough that it doesn’t have a lot of those extra features that distract from some of the main parts
of the game. And don’t get me wrong: I think that 1.16 minecraft has many advantages over Xbox 360 edition.
If I were playing 360 single player, it may not be quite as entertaining, but just as a version to play with
your family or friends, it’s quite nice.</p>

<p>	Now you may ask “what makes THIS edition the perfect balance?” I think there are a few key features that
    it has that push it over simple, boring minecraft to being my favorite version. One is enchanting. To be
    able to enchant your gear is something an important part of the game that takes a great deal of time and
    adds complexity and dominance to it, and I’m glad 360 has it. Another one is the variation of biomes. In
    my world I have a forest biome, a swamp biome and one of those biomes with spruce trees and snow (I honestly
    don’t know what they’re called.) There probably are more, I haven’t explored the whole 862 x 862 world I
    have. I’ve heard there are desert and jungle biomes in some seeds. And yes, it is small, but big enough
    there will be no resource shortages of things like iron or diamonds. There is simple redstone, nothing so
    that you could make massive AFK farms like you can nowadays though. This is good, you have to put in the
    effort, the grind to get these resources, not just build a farm and sit there while the resources roll in. 
    It’s a simpler, slower paced game and I really like it. </p>
<p>	If you’re someone who is into building, you may not have as much block variation as you’re used to but
    you’ll have enough to make some cool stuff. My house uses oak logs for the corners, stone for the walls and
    a little cobblestone accent below it to make it look good. It’s currently 2 stories tall, but I will add
    at least one more before putting on a spruce stair roof. Sorry, I can’t attach a picture since I can’t
    figure out how to take a screenshot on the 360 and transfer it to here but you can hopefully visualize it
    in your head a bit. </p>
<p>	So there are my reasons for why the 360 edition is my favorite version. The perfect balance of simplicity
    and complexity, and the way Minecraft was intended. I am normally a PC person and though I think when it
    comes to controls and performance the PC definitely wins, I think there’s quite a few reasons you should
    try 360 edition if possible. You may feel the same way I do about it.</p>
