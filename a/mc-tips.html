<h1>My Minecraft Survival Tips</h1>
<p>I have played Minecraft for about 6 years and I have collected a great deal of knowledge and experience about 
it along the way. Survival is, like most people, the main game mode I play and I have some tips about it 
I want to share. </p>
<h3>Early Game</h3>
<p>Early in the game there are a few things you want to do and not do to make sure you don’t waste resources. 
The first one is whenever you move up in the tool levels (ex. Stone to iron, then iron to diamond) you <strong>ALWAYS
MAKE THE PICKAXE FIRST.</strong> I can’t stress this enough. The pickaxe is the most valuable of the tool sets,
without it you couldn’t really get anywhere in Minecraft and in order to keep getting new ores you need to keep
upgrading your pickaxe (for example you can’t mine diamonds with a stone pickaxe or ancient debris with an iron
pick.) My other big early game tip is to <strong>NEVER MAKE LEATHER ARMOR.</strong> Leather armor is a pretty bad type of armor
made from a resource that is rather rare and a pain to get. Anyone who plays minecraft knows what I’m talking
about when I say leather is a pain to get: you can’t ever find a cow when you need one, and you need this leather
later on when you make your enchanting table setup or repair your elytra. Just save up for some iron armor, it’s
not that hard especially if you find a big cave or abandoned mine shaft. Speaking of cows, when you’re going out
looking for food cows are the best to kill since they drop up to 1 to 3 beef. You may be saying “well pigs drop
the same amount and porkchop restores more hunger” but cows have the added bonus of leather, whereas pigs drop
nothing except pork chops. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Chickens are the easiest to kill but they drop the least food (only one piece of chicken) and you can’t
eat it raw or you’ll get food poisoning. </strong></p>
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Naturally Generated Structures</h3>
<p>When you’re exploring in Minecraft you’ll find some naturally generated structures like villages, desert temples
and dungeons. There are special ways to go about these. When you find a village and it’s somewhat near your base
you should try and mob proof it as much as you can if you have any interest in keeping the villagers for trading
later. A common mistake that I have definitely made is to think, “Oh, the villagers are okay. They’re not super
close to my base so most mobs won’t spawn and besides, they have an iron golem.” Don’t think like this. I had one
village with probably 10 to 15 villagers and now there are just TWO. Issue is I use those villagers to trade for many
essential resources so they are a big loss. My tip for dungeons (aka mob spawners) is <strong>NEVER BREAK THE 
SPAWNER BLOCK.</strong> You will regret it later since these are awesome for a crude xp farm. I am so glad I have
my skeleton grinding farm since not only are these easy to build and give you good xp, I also have endless bones,
arrows, and bows, which is nice since those are kinda annoying materials to get without a farm. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Use critical hits to kill enemies faster and do less damage to your sword. To critical hit you jump in the
air while hitting the target. </strong></p>
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Exploring</h3>
<p>So I’ve talked about naturally generated structures, but what about finding them? Here is my tips section for
exploring. My best tip is to screenshot the coordinates of your base if you have a hard time remembering them since
getting lost in minecraft is just about the worst feeling on earth. My other tip is TAKE A HORSE, especially if you
have no Elytra. Some breeds of horses are really fast and cover ground, probably double the speed you can sprint
at, all without using a single piece of food. It’s also really safe to travel at night since when you’re moving 
fast creepers don't have time to blow up and skeletons will miss. The one caveat is that they aren’t so good in
some biomes like jungles and they are virtually impossible in oceans. Even crossing a river can be hard in these
things. So if you want to go really far over different kinds of terrain, elytra are your best bet, but I don’t need
to even write that since it’s rather obvious. Some stuff to bring on your journey are a compass, at least a half
a stack of food, blocks and perhaps a golden apple in case you find yourself in a dangerous situation (for example
riding your horse into lava. I’m not joking.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Diamonds, golden apples and enchanted books are among the best items that spawn in desert temples. Some
of the more common ones are gunpowder, bones and string.</strong></p>
<br />
<h3>The Nether</h3>
<p>I have only a couple nether tips and they’re not super revolutionary but they’re good to remember. <strong>CARRY A FLINT
AND STEEL AT ALL TIMES</strong> since there is a decent chance you’ll be running back to your portal and a ghast will shoot
out the flame. If you don’t have flint and steel you are stuck here. Your best way out is to kill yourself close to
your portal so you don’t lose all your stuff then return from the overworld but this is still risky. Another tip i
n the nether is mark the way back to your portal well since the landscape in the nether is very different from the overworld.
There are massive floating landforms that will drop down onto a flat area at lava level. There are big islands high
above the lava that can feel like you’re at a “normal level” but you really aren’t since there isn’t actually any “normal level”
in the nether. It’s all relative and this can make navigating hard, not to mention dangerous. Screenshot your portal coordinates
and use a block not found in the nether (maybe cobblestone or sand) so that you can easily distinguish your markers from the natural
landscape. Beware of getting lost; for the nether is built like a maze and a wary player will get lost easily. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Did you know that cobblestone won’t get blown up by ghast blasts? Though it may not look the best it’s the best thing to
build your nether castle out of.</strong></p>
<hr />
<br />
<h3>Mining</h3>
<p>Mining is probably the most important part of Minecraft, as the name implies. I find it rather meditative and
there is no better feeling than seeing that blue glint of diamonds. Most people know that diamonds are most commonly
found at y=12 or below and that doing a branch mine is probably the best strategy. Here I will cover ancient debris mining.
A lot of people say, “use beds and tnt, it’s the fastest” but I actually disagree. When you blow stuff up with beds you
need to be sure to keep a good order of where you blow up or else you’ll end up with a massive flaming cave that is rather
confusing. You’ll spend way too much time deciding where to place the beds when you could mine out that whole area in under
30 seconds with a diamond pick, and the pickaxe method is neater and involves less fire. Just mine like you might in the
overworld and you’ll find a good deal of ancient debris as long as you’re deep enough. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>While mining, don’t throw away coal to make space in your inventory: it’s one of those resources you think you have
a ton of but then you go to use your furnace and you’re almost out. </strong></p>
<hr />I hope you’ve enjoyed my tips and find them useful! I know some of these are a little more obvious than others but these are how
I’ve been able to keep a successful survival world so I hope these help you out!
